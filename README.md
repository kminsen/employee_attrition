# employee_attrition

This repository represents my first foray into data science, specifically focusing on analyzing employee attrition using various machine learning and statistical methods. Throughout this project, I have applied fundamental data science techniques, from initial data visualization and feature engineering to advanced modeling and survival analysis. Each step is meticulously documented and visualized, providing valuable insights into the factors influencing employee attrition.

This project has been a significant learning experience, showcasing my ability to handle real-world data, perform exploratory data analysis, and implement and evaluate different machine learning models. The skills and knowledge gained from this project lay a solid foundation for future data science endeavors.

Feel free to explore the notebooks and modify the code to suit your needs. Contributions and suggestions are welcome as I continue to grow and refine my data science expertise.

## Dataset
Uncover the factors that lead to employee attrition and explore important questions such as ‘show me a breakdown of distance from home by job role and attrition’ or ‘compare average monthly income by education and attrition’. This is a fictional data set created by IBM data scientists. [Link to dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/pavansubhasht/ibm-hr-analytics-attrition-dataset)
